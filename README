command-not-found
------------------

command-not-found is a python script which intercepts bash when a command
is not found. It searches through a binary database file for finding out
which PiSi package provides this command and informs the user.

Note that bash doesn't call this script when a command is given
with an absolute path.

The binary db file is a pickled dictionary associating absolute paths
to package names. It's installed into /var/command-not-found.
